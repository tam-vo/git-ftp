git-ftp
=======

Auto sync commits in GIT and FTP server when you ONLY have FTP permission to access remote server

## Introduction:
Sometimes, you just have FTP permission to deploy your work to FTP
Server, and it's becoming horribly when you need to remember which
files should be uploaded, which files should be ignored... An
altertive solution is that you can upload whole your project to FTP
Server, but it may take long time to deploy successfully.

So here I want to take an advantage of Git and use integratedly with FTP
Server.

## Usage:
- Clone this repo
- Edit ftp_config.yml with your FTP credentials
- Ruby this command to auto sync from one commit to the other one.

```ruby
ruby "ftp_upload.rb" SHA_FROM SHA_TO
```
